        <li>100g full-cream milk powder.</li>
        <li>40g plain flour.</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder.</li>
        <li>50g of <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/glossary/ghee-glossary">ghe</a> or softened unsalted butter plus 1kg ghee, for frying.</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of natural yogurt.</li>
        <li>Aqueeze of lemon juice.</li>
        <li>4-5 tablespoons whole milk.</li>
        <li>Sunflower oil</li>
      </ul>
    <h2 class="generic">Preparation</h2>
    <ol class="item" type="i">
      <li>To make the syrup, gently heat the cardamom, sugar and 500ml water in a saucepan. Don't let the water boil before the sugar has dissolved. Simmer for 10 mins, then cool.</li>
      <li>Gradually add the rosewater, saffron and a little of its soaking liquid until you have a subtly flavoured syrup. Set aside.</li>
      <li>To make the gulab jamun, use a pestle and mortar to grind together the cardamom and sugar until fine.</li>
      <li>Sieve the milk powder, flour and baking powder into a mixing bowl and stir in the cardamom and sugar mixture. Rub in the 50g ghee or butter using your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
      <li>Add the yogurt, lemon juice and enough milk to form a soft dough, taking care not to overwork the mixture.</li>
      <li>Oil your hands with a little sunflower oil and shape small portions of the dough into walnut-sized balls, about 3cm in diameter and 20g each. Make sure the dumplings are smooth and have no cracks or folds.</li>
      <li>Reheat the syrup until it comes to the boil, then turn off the heat and cover with a lid.</li>
      <li>Heat the 1kg ghee in a wok or karahi to 130C or until a small piece of dough dropped in turns golden in 40 seconds. Fry the balls, in batches, over a medium heat for 5-7 mins, moving them around until they are an even, deep brown. Remove from the saucepan using a slotted spoon, then drain on kitchen paper. Add to the warm syrup, leaving them to soak for 2-3 hrs or preferably overnight.</li>
      <li>When ready to eat, warm the gulab jamun through in a wide saucepan, spooning over the syrup. Serve piping hot with the pistachios scattered over.</li>
