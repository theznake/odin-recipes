    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Some departmens here in Colombia have it as dessert. It is one of my favourite traditional dishes. It's basically made with cooked corn, and milk.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Most of the ingredients are quite easy to get. You can replace panela with sugar, if needed.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>250 grams of dry white hominy or 1 can white hominy (Pozole).</li>
        <li>100 grams of panela.</li>
        <li>2 cups of milk.</li>
        <li>1 pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Approximately 4 cups water.</li>
        <li>100 grams panela, brown sugar or muscovado sugar and guava paste as accompaniment.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>Mazamorra is quite easy to cook, but you must prepare a few things beforehand. You can serve it cold, or warm.</p>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>Wash and remove impurities that always come in the White hominy package.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, place the corn to soak in two cups of water and let stand for at least 8 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>Place corn, water & salt in a saucepan and cook for at least 1 hour over medium heat or until corn is tender.</li>
        <li>Add sugar and cook for 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li>In another pot, boil the milk.</li>
        <li>Then add the corn and simmer for a few minutes more.</li>        
      </ol>
